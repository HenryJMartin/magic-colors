        <p class="body content">So, you're getting into Magic: The Gathering. You've watched some guides on YouTube, figured out the basic rules, 
           and maybe you've even bought some cards. But now comes the tricky part: Deckbuilding. Where do you even begin to 
           figure out which strategies to employ, which cards are better in certain decks, and so on? Well, a good starting 
           point is learning about the five core strategies of any Magic deck, embodied by the five colors of green, red, 
           black, white, and blue. They all use the same fundamental mechanics, but each color presents its own particular 
           play style and flavor. Click any of the links below to learn more about each color!</p>
