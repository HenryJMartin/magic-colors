    <h3>Prosperous Order - White</h2>
    <img src="../images/white.png">
    <p>In Magic, White cards are all about law, order, bravery, 
       and heroics. While at a glance, it's basically the “good” 
       color, playing a White deck can certainly employ a lot of 
       ruthless tactics.</p>
    <p>White cards are the best at locking down your opponent's 
       side of the field, leaving them vulnerable to a powerful 
       counterattack. Here are the a some of the more notable 
       attributes of a White playstyle:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cards with lots of rules and conditions, but powerful effects
        </li>
        <li>Highly defensive strategies that favor strategic offensive pushes
        </li>
        <li>Being able to stay in the fight very easily
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Like all other colors, White has creature effects and spells 
       that are rarely if ever found with other colors, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gaining life via spells and creature effects
        </li>
        <li>Permanently removing opponent's permanents
        </li>
        <li>Giving your creatures various powerful effects with enchantment spells
        </li>
        <li>Tapping opponent's creatures to stall them, and tapping 
            your own creatures to trigger strong abilities
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want a good mix of sustainability and raw power, White is a solid choice!</p>
