    <h3>Untapped Potential - Blue</h2>
    <img src="../images/blue.png">
    <p>In Magic, no color plays quite like Blue. Blue isn't 
       about getting good creatures or dealing lots of damage. 
       Blue's strength is subverting the fundamental mechanics 
       of the game, and achieving victory in entirely unforeseen 
       ways.</p>
    <p>Blue's creatures are perhaps the least noteworthy compared 
       to its spells, which you'll see a lot of in all sorts of 
       decks. Here are the a few ways those spells define a Blue 
       playstyle:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The ability to cancel entire playstyles with just a few cards
        </li>
        <li>Undermining basic strategies to stay in the game way longer than expected
        </li>
        <li>Bending the rules to suit yourself and the gamestate
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Like all other colors, Blue has creature effects and spells 
       that are rarely if ever found with other colors, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Removing cards from your opponent's library directly
        </li>
        <li>Creatures with high toughness but low, sometimes no power
        </li>
        <li>Bringing spell cards back from the graveyard
        </li>
        <li>Countering all types of spells</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If breaking the game to tweek it to your liking is a 
       tantalizing prospect, then try out Blue!</p>
