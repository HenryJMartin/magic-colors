    <h3>Fiery Aggression - Red</h2>
    <img src="../images/red.png">
    <p>In Magic, Red is all about aggression and activeness. 
       Red's playstyles revolve around sending damage to your 
       opponent's face as fast as possible, and a player that 
       loses that momentum loses Red's power with it.</p>
    <p>Red cards will either pepper your opponent relentlessly 
       or uttery demolish them in a single blow. Here are the a 
       few of the most prevalent attributes of a Red playstyle:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Amassing a horde of weak creatures to throw at the enemy</li>
        <li>Sacrificing creatures and other resources quickly to achieve immediate results</li>
        <li>Keeping the pressure going until a powerful spell or creature is put into play, 
            ensuring a devastating victory</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Like all other colors, Red has creature effects and spells that are rarely if ever 
       found with other colors, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dealing damage to any target that takes damage, from 
            creatures to your opponent to yourself</li>
        <li>Creatures that can attack immediately</li>
        <li>Creatures that can become very powerful for a single turn</li>
        <li>Destroying opponents' land cards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If going into battle fast and furiously is for you, then so is Red!</p>
