    <h3>Untamed Power - Green</h2>
    <img src="../images/green.png">
    <p>In Magic, Green cards focus on generating resources, 
       and turning those resources into immense power. It 
       relies on enchantments, instants and sorceries to 
       stave off the enemy offense until its creatures can 
       be put into play.</p>
    <p>Green decks are largely creature-focused, but there's 
       plenty of variation among said creatures. Here's what 
       you can expect from a Green playstyle:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lots of mana, and ways to generate mana</li>
        <li>Big creatures with a balance of defensive and offensive capabilities
        </li>
        <li>Spells that remove powerful objects your opponent will likely use</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Like all other colors, Green has creature effects and 
        spells that are rarely if ever found with other colors, 
        such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lots of creatures with high toughness and power</li>
        <li>Offensive effects like Trample, and defensive effects like Reach
        </li>
        <li>Spells that destroy almost every type of permanent
        </li>
        <li>Creatures that can be tapped for mana
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If big creatures and lots of them are your thing, then go Green today!
    </p>
