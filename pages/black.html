    <h3>Ruthless Ambition - Black</h3>
    <img src="../images/black.png">
    <p>In Magic, Black cards are often characterized by monsters, vampires, 
       zombies, and generally unpleasant things. While not technically an 
       “evil” color, here you’ll find the most cards and playstyles that fall 
       on the negative side of the moral spectrum.</p>
    <p>Black is all about using your spells and creatures in unorthodox, 
       aggressive ways to achieve powerful results. Here are the a few 
       of the most prevalent attributes of a Black playstyle:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Removing threats quickly and efficiently</li>
        <li>Using your creatures, as well as artifacts and even 
            cards in your hand, as resources in addition to mana</li>
        <li>Being extremely stubborn, always finding a way to 
            stay in the fight a little bit longer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Like all other colors, Black has creature effects and spells 
       that are rarely if ever found with other colors, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Draining your opponent’s life total directly</li>
        <li>Destroying your opponent’s creatures without dealing damage</li>
        <li>Bringing your own creatures back from the graveyard</li>
        <li>Getting to see your opponent’s hand</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you want to play a game of schemes, ruthlessness and resilience, 
       Black is the color for you!</p>
